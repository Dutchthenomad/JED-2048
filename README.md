## 🎮 Bot in Action

Watch the JED-2048 bot make intelligent decisions in real-time:

### Step 2: UP Move Decision

![Demo Screenshot 1](demo_screenshot_1.png)

**Game Analysis:**
- **Empty Tiles:** 12/16
- **Highest Tile:** 8
- **Recommended Move:** UP
- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - UP: 2400.0 points (✓ Best choice)
  - DOWN: 1200.0 points
  - LEFT: 1800.0 points
  - RIGHT: 1600.0 points

The bot prioritizes moves that maximize empty tiles and create merge opportunities in the top corner.

### Step 4: LEFT Move Decision

![Demo Screenshot 2](demo_screenshot_2.png)

**Game Analysis:**
- **Empty Tiles:** 9/16
- **Highest Tile:** 16
- **Recommended Move:** LEFT
- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - UP: 1800.0 points
  - DOWN: 800.0 points
  - LEFT: 2800.0 points (✓ Best choice)
  - RIGHT: 1100.0 points

Strategic LEFT move keeps the highest tile (16) in the corner while setting up a merge sequence.

### Step 7: UP Move Decision

![Demo Screenshot 3](demo_screenshot_3.png)

**Game Analysis:**
- **Empty Tiles:** 6/16
- **Highest Tile:** 32
- **Recommended Move:** UP
- **Decision Reasoning:**
  - UP: 3200.0 points (✓ Best choice)
  - DOWN: 900.0 points
  - LEFT: 2100.0 points
  - RIGHT: 1400.0 points

Advanced board state with 32-tile achieved. Bot maintains corner strategy while maximizing merge potential.

*Screenshots show the bot's computer vision analyzing the live game board and the strategy system scoring each possible move in real-time. The Enhanced Heuristic algorithm considers empty tiles (weight: 150), merge potential (weight: 100), corner strategy (weight: 250), and monotonicity (weight: 75).*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup
```bash
make setup    # Creates venv, installs dependencies, Playwright browsers
```

### Run the Bot
```bash
make run      # Opens visible browser and runs autonomous game
make run16    # Runs 16-move demonstration
```

### Algorithm Selection
```python
from enhanced_2048_bot import Enhanced2048Bot

bot = Enhanced2048Bot()
bot.list_available_algorithms()
# ['Basic Priority', 'Random', 'Enhanced Heuristic']

bot.set_algorithm("Enhanced Heuristic")
bot.play_game()
```

### Student Platform
```python
from student_platform import StudentPlatform

platform = StudentPlatform()
platform.submit_algorithm("my_algorithm.py", student_name="Alice")
platform.run_competition(num_games=10)
results = platform.get_leaderboard()
```

## 📊 Performance Baselines

- **Enhanced Heuristic**: 2.36 points/move efficiency (current best)
- **Human Baseline**: 11.54 points/move (target for students)
- **Consistent Achievement**: 32-tile reach with optimized strategies
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Built-in benchmarking vs baseline implementations
