# Contributing to JED-2048

Welcome to the JED-2048 educational platform! This guide will help you contribute algorithms, improvements, and educational content.

## üéØ Ways to Contribute

### 1. Algorithm Development
Implement new strategies using the standard algorithm interface:

```python
from algorithms.base_algorithm import BaseAlgorithm

class YourAlgorithm(BaseAlgorithm):
    def get_move(self, board_state):
        """
        Analyze board and return best move

        Args:
            board_state: 4x4 list of integers (0 for empty)

        Returns:
            str: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", or "RIGHT"
        """
        # Your strategy logic here
        return "UP"

    def get_name(self):
        return "Your Algorithm Name"

    def get_description(self):
        return "Brief description of your approach"
```

### 2. Performance Improvements

## üìã Submission Guidelines

### Algorithm Submissions

1. **Create Algorithm File**
   ```bash
   # Place in appropriate category
   algorithms/student_submissions/your_algorithm.py
   algorithms/heuristic/advanced_strategy.py
   algorithms/reinforcement_learning/deep_q_network.py
   ```

2. **Required Components**
   - Inherit from `BaseAlgorithm`
   - Implement `get_move()` method
   - Add clear documentation
   - Include performance analysis

3. **Testing Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Test your algorithm
   python -c "
   from your_algorithm import YourAlgorithm
   from student_platform import StudentPlatform

   platform = StudentPlatform()
   platform.submit_algorithm('your_algorithm.py', 'Your Name')
   platform.run_validation()
   "
   ```

### Code Quality Standards

- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and comments
- **Type Hints**: Use Python type annotations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery
- **Testing**: Include unit tests where applicable

### Performance Benchmarks

Your algorithm will be evaluated on:
- **Efficiency**: Average points per move
- **Consistency**: Score variance across games
- **Highest Tile**: Maximum tile achieved
- **Game Completion**: Success rate reaching higher tiles

Target baselines:
- **Beginner**: > 1.0 points/move, reach 128 tile
- **Intermediate**: > 2.0 points/move, reach 256 tile
- **Advanced**: > 2.5 points/move, reach 512 tile
- **Expert**: > 3.0 points/move, reach 1024+ tile
